<!-I'm not very good at poetry, and I don't like reading it. Sometimes I think poets are selfish because they expect me to spend my own time reading whatever THEY want me to read, when in reality there's no benefit to me reading their poetry, and I'd much rather read a nonfiction book or a novel if I'm in the mood or even the newspaper, anything but their pansy-ass attempt to capture a moment or whatever it is we call life. Poetry is depressing because it DWELLS on moments, and it draws out emotions and makes you aware that you're drawing out emotions. You're not supposed to do this, you're just supposed to feel, and when you break this rule your punishment is depression.->

I normally don't write poems, but you like them so I'll try.

<!-In English class in high school we always had to analyze poems, and nobody ever seemed to be as affected emotionally as me.->

Roses are red, violets are blue.

<!-In literature class in college, I prefer the poems nobody else likes, the ones that are straightforward and tell you exactly what they mean. I HATE those poems that tell you a setting, the ones that seem innocent and say "we had a lovely time in the park, and there were lots of birds." It's never about the birds, is it? They're a metaphor for DEATH or a reminder of the parasitical nature of society, according to my professors.->

Sugar is sweet, and so are you.

<!-Even when I've "figured out" those poems, it's impossible to feel satisfied or accomplished, because the emotion is there from before, when I didn't know what the birds stood for but I knew they made me feel bad inside. That's why I don't like poetry.->

<!-But I love you.->
